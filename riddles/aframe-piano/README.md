# aframe-keyboard-sound

## Things to try ...

- Use the mouse to press the piano keys
- Hover over the piano and press [1] to [6] on your computer keyboard
- use a stereo head set

## This demo shows ...

- how you can split a gltf model into a static part (the piano) and dynamic parts (piano keys)
- how to access the dynamic parts using the gltf-parts component
- how to use event-set to simulate pressing down piano keys
- how to use event-set to set to play an audio file
- how to use proxy-event to translate key events to mouse events
- a custom switch component to activate keyboard-controls, when we are hovering the piano
- how to create two pianos (using ids to identify the pianos and classes to identify their keys)
